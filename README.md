# smartsensing

This project is part of a WSN solution, developed as a graduation project.
Having a WSN set up, a USB packet sniffer connected to your machine and a MQTT broker running on localhost, this project aims to be a software solution for integrating the MQTT messages receiver with a database storage.
It also has an app interface, for GUI access to the stored data.

Pre-requisites:
- MQTT Broker: Latest Mosquitto version must be installed and running. Information can be found at: https://mosquitto.org/download/
